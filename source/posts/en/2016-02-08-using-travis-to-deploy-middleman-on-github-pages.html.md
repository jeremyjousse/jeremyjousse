I recently created a blog scaffold for a friend of my using Middleman.
Using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} in addition
to Middleman allows my friend to host his blog without any charge.
This is great but my friend is not a geek, and he does not hold back all the
Middleman boring commands to commit, generate, and deploy his blog.

I finaly found [prose.io](http://prose.io/){:target="_blank"} a content editor
for GitHub designed for managing websites. With a little my time of configuring
[prose.io](http://prose.io/){:target="_blank"}, my friend has finally a GUI
editor to handle his Middleman blog.

The last challenge was to automate the build and deployment of his blog after
each commit.
